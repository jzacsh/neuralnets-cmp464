 I have created a lab for you to finish (while you wait-- remember that you can
 collaborate but must tell me with whom)your assignment to try to learn OR,AND
 and XOR using matrix methods and cost functions. 
 Please read the annotated program( read the comments) below that takes you
 almost to the finish of your assignment. Try to finish the assignment and then
 answer questions that I have put in the comments.
